# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Status
**Phase**: Product Management Module Development (completed and committed)
**Last Activity**: Successfully committed and pushed all product management files to git (commit c633042)
**Next Focus**: Testing and system optimization

## Recent Accomplishments

### ✅ Product Management System (Just Completed)
1. **Brand Management**
   - Full CRUD operations with validation
   - Brand model with unique constraints
   - React components with shadcn/ui integration
   - Permission-based access control

2. **Category Management**
   - Complete category CRUD functionality
   - Hierarchical category support ready
   - Consistent UI patterns with other modules
   - Proper form validation and error handling

3. **Product Management**
   - Comprehensive product catalog system
   - Brand and category relationships
   - Units per package tracking (`nombre_unite_par_colis`)
   - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
   - Print-ready product listings

### ✅ Core Infrastructure (Previously Completed)
- User authentication with Laravel Breeze
- Role-based permission system
- Client-Commercial relationship management
- Territory management (Villes/Secteurs)
- Print functionality for client lists

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priorities
1. **System Integration Testing**
   - Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
   - Test permission enforcement across modules
   - Validate data relationships and constraints

2. **Code Quality Review**
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all modules
   - Verify TypeScript types are properly defined
   - Check for any remaining lint errors or warnings

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review database queries for N+1 issues
   - Optimize table pagination and search
   - Ensure proper eager loading relationships

## Recent Technical Decisions

### Database Design Choices
- Added `nombre_unite_par_colis` to products table for inventory tracking
- Implemented unique constraints on product libelle for data integrity
- Used proper foreign key relationships throughout

### Frontend Architecture
- Maintained consistent component structure across all modules
- Used dialog modals for create/edit operations
- Implemented reusable pagination and search components
- Followed shadcn/ui patterns for all new components

### Permission Strategy
- Extended permission system to include brand/category/product permissions
- Maintained consistent permission naming convention
- Integrated permissions into both backend policies and frontend visibility

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Pending Items
1. **Testing Coverage**: Need to add tests for new modules
   - Unit tests for new models
   - Feature tests for new controllers
   - Component tests for new React components

2. **Documentation Updates**: 
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - User guide updates for new features
   - Database schema documentation

### Technical Debt
- Some duplicate code patterns could be abstracted
- Table components have similar pagination logic
- Form validation patterns could be more standardized

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Immediate (Current Session)
- [x] Commit all new files to git repository (commit c633042)
- [x] Push changes to remote repository 
- [ ] Run full test suite to verify no regressions
- [ ] Update any broken routes or permissions

### 2. Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for new modules
- [ ] Implement any missing permissions or policies
- [ ] Optimize database queries and relationships
- [ ] Add data export functionality for products

### 3. Medium Term (Next Week)
- [ ] Implement inventory tracking features
- [ ] Add advanced reporting capabilities
- [ ] Create data import/export tools
- [ ] Enhance search and filtering options

## Patterns & Insights Learned

### What's Working Well
1. **Consistent Component Architecture**: The established pattern of index.tsx → AppTable.tsx → components/ is scaling well
2. **Permission Integration**: The permission hooks and policy integration provides good security
3. **Dialog Modal Pattern**: Users prefer modal dialogs over separate pages for CRUD operations
4. **Search Integration**: Global search with server-side filtering performs well

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Code Duplication**: Table components share a lot of similar logic
2. **Form Validation**: Could benefit from shared validation patterns
3. **Type Safety**: Some areas still need better TypeScript coverage
4. **Testing**: Need better test coverage for complex interactions

### Key Technical Insights
- Inertia.js works excellently for this type of CRUD application
- shadcn/ui components provide good consistency and accessibility
- Laravel 12's auto-discovery features simplify development
- Permission-based UI rendering improves user experience significantly

## Development Environment Notes
- Running on Windows with PowerShell
- Using Vite for fast frontend development
- Database migrations are working correctly
- No major configuration issues encountered
