## 🔄 Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions That Worked
- **Inertia.js SPA**: Excellent balance of SPA benefits with Laravel simplicity
- **Permission System**: spatie/laravel-permission provides robust access control
- **Component Structure**: Consistent patterns scale well across modules
- **Modal Dialogs**: Users prefer modals over separate pages for CRUD operations

### Lessons Learned
- **Code Patterns**: Establishing patterns early pays dividends in consistency
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing catches issues early in development
- **Database Design**: Proper relationships prevent data integrity issues
- **UI Consistency**: shadcn/ui components provide excellent foundation

### Decisions to Reconsider
- **Table Logic**: Some duplication could be abstracted into reusable hooks
- **Form Validation**: More standardization would reduce boilerplate
- **Error Handling**: Could be more user-friendly and comprehensive
- **Testing Strategy**: Need more automated testing throughout development
